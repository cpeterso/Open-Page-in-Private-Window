  Hello! I'm Chris Peterson, the developer of the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/open-page-in-private-window/" target="_blank">"Open In Private Window"</a> Firefox extension. Thank you for installing my extension! Note that it won't work unless you tell Firefox to allow it to run in Private Windows. Otherwise it can't open pages in Private Windows, which is the whole point of this extension. :) <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/extensions-private-browsing#w_enabling-or-disabling-extensions-in-private-windows" target="_blank">Mozilla's step-by-step instructions</a> will show you how.
