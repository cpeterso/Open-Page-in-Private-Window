<b>"Open Page in Private Window"</b> is a Firefox extension that enables you to easily open a copy of the current page in a new Private Window. This is useful for reading articles on websites that limit the number of articles you can read per month. This extension does not clear your browsing history or close the original tab. You can activate this extension from the "Open Page in Private Window" context menu item or an optional toolbar button.

<b>WARNING: You must allow Firefox to run this extension in Private Windows!</b> Otherwise it can't open pages in Private Windows, which is the whole point of this extension. :) Here are Mozilla's instructions for granting the "Run in Private Windows" permission when you install the extension or later in about:addons: <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/kb/extensions-private-browsing">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/extensions-private-browsing</a>
